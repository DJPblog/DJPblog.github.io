Whilst searching for jobs a common theme regually came up: what events do you do in regards to your degree, outside of your degree? 

The reason they ask this is more than likely to make sure that you enjoy doing what you do, rather than just being in for the money. This led myself and a few friends to enter as many of these as possible before september 2018, the first being Google Hashcode. 

"go into what the task was and how we we did to solve it"
