The quest for employability 

Whilst searching for jobs a common theme regually came up: what events do you do in regards to your degree, outside of your degree? 

The reason they ask this is more than likely to make sure that you enjoy doing what you do, rather than just being in for the money. This led myself and a few friends to enter as many of these as possible before september 2018, the first being Google Hashcode. Below is a practice example they send to try and get you in the right frame of mind. 

<b>The Challenge </b> 

The practice issue Google provided was named 'Pizza' and the aim was to slice the pizza to the specification they provided you with. The pizza had two ingredients, mushroom and tomato, with each ingredient taking up one grid. You are provided with three specifications: 

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>The minimum and maximum slice size</li>
  <li>The minimum and maximum amount of each ingredient on each slice</li>
  <li>The column and row size of the pizza</li>
</ul> 

This leaves you something lie the below, which is the small pizza grid specifications.
